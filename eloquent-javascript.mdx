## Values, Types, and Operators

[Chapter 1 - Link](https://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html)

**type coercion** - when JavaScript quietly converts a value to the type it needs, using a set of rules that often arenâ€™t what you want or expect.

`===` - operator to test whether a value is precisely equal to the other. No attempt at type conversion will take place.  
`!===` - operator to test whether a value is **not** precisely equal to the other. No attempt at type conversion will take place.

## Program Structure

**expression** - a fragment of code that produces a value.  
**statement** -

Executing a function is called _involking_, _calling_, or _applying_ it.
